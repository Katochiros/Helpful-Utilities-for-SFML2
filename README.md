# Helpful-Utilities-for-SFML2
Some basic functions that can help make life using SFML2 that little bit easier.  This repo will be updated periodically as the functions within will be from my own personal projects which are developed continually.

Obviously, this requires any projects be setup with SFML2 (linked, included).

The text class simply allows static calling of functions to draw text to screen
using SFML's functions and classes.  Before use, though, the class needs to be 
initialised using the Text::initialise() function. Obviously, this is best
called as close to the beginning of your program as possible.
